MOSTs (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Transistors)
# MOS: Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor
## Principles
![[50.png|400]]
> Applying a voltage between two metal plates separated by an insulator results in the build-up of charges +Q and –Q on the plates and an E-field. In a metal-air-metal capacitor, all the charges reside on the surface and the E-field does not penetrate into the metal.

1. There will be that many number of positive metal ions and electrons on the surface.
2. The charges +_Q_ and –_Q_ can therefore be generated by the electrons and metal ions at the surface alone. The E-field terminates at the metal surface.
![[51.png|400]]
> **Insufficient** number of negative acceptors at the surface to generate the charge –_Q_. Therefore, we must **expose negative acceptors in the bulk**.
> **The field penetrates into the semiconductor.**

Depletion layer
> A positive voltage creates a depletion layer by forcing the positively charged holes **away** from the metal/insulator/semiconductor interface, **leaving exposed a carrier-free region of immobile**, **negatively** charged **acceptor ions**. The region into which the field penetrates is therefore depleted of its equilibrium concentration of holes.

This is a **depletion layer**. We can estimate **W** since $Q=qAWN_a$
![[52.png|400]]
> If V is high enough, **a high concentration of negative charge carriers forms in an inversion layer located in a thin layer next to the interface between the semiconductor and the insulator**. Conventionally, the gate voltage at which the volume density of electrons in the inversion layer is the same as the volume density of holes in the body is called the threshold voltage. $V > V_{th}$, an inversion layer is created near the surface in which there are conduction electrons

 ## Structure
 1. In addition to the Body/bulk and the Gate terminal in a MOS capacitor, a MOSFET has two additional terminals called Source and Drain.
 2. Each of these is connected to individual highly doped regions that are separated by the bulk region.
 3. Each of these is connected to individual highly doped regions that are separated by the bulk region.
 4. The source and drain (unlike the bulk) are highly doped as signified by a "+" sign after the type of doping.

# Enhancement MOSFET

> (a) **Below threshold** $V_{GS} < V_{th}$ **and** $V_{DS}= 0$. Depletion layer forms due to expulsion of holes. Now, increasing $V_{GS}$ beyond threshold ($V_{DS}=0$) results in an inversion layer to form in the p-type semiconductor, which links the two $n^+$ regions of source and drain.
> (b) **Above threshold** $V_{GS}>V_{th}$ **and by applying a small** $V_{DS}(V_{DS}<V_{DS(sat)})$. a current $𝐼_𝐷$ flows, which is limited by the resistance of the n-channel:$$I_D=\frac{V_{DS}}{R_n}$$
> The current, $𝐼_𝐷$ increases linearly with $V_{DS}$ in this region.

![[54.png|400]]
> (c) **Above threshold $V_{GS}>V_{th}$ and $V_{DS}=V_{DS(sat)}$.** As $V_{DS}$ is increased, voltage at $V_{GD}$ decrease since $V_{GD}=V_{GS}-V_{DS}$. There is less inversion near the drain and the channel gets narrower as well as $R_{ch}$ increasing. When $V_{GD}$ is just $≤ V_{th}$, we start to expose the depletion layer and pinch-off is obtained.Thus, $V_{DS}=V_{DS(sat)}$ and $V_{GD}=V_{GS}-V_{DS(sat)}=V_{th}$
> (d) **Above threshold $V_{GS}>V_{th}$ and $V_{DS}>V_{DS(sat)}$** additional $V_{DS}$ drops across depletion layer, which extends to P’. Resistance of channel changes slightly and $𝐼_{𝐷𝑆}$ becomes: $$I_D\approx I_{DS}\approx \frac{V_{DS(sat)}}{R_{AP'(n-ch)}}$$

## Enhancement NMOSFET
Called enhancement, since a gate voltage is required to **_enhance_** a conducting channel between source and drain.
**Enhancement NMOSFET constant**
$$K=\frac{Z\mu_e\epsilon}{2Lt_{ox}}(AV^{-2}), sometimes\ \frac{\epsilon}{t_{ox}}=C_{ox} "oxide\ capacitance"$$
> where $𝜇_𝑒$ is the electron drift mobility in the channel, _L_ and _Z_ are the length and width of the gate controlling the channel, and 𝜀 and $t_{ox}$ are the permittivity ($𝜀_r 𝜀_o$) and thickness of the oxide insulation under the gate respectively.

**Enhancement MOSFET in LINEAR REGION**
$$I_{DS}=K[2(V_{GS}-V_{th})V_{DS}-V_{DS}^2]$$
**Enhancement MOSFET in SATURATION REGION**
$$I_{DS}=K(V_{GS}-V_{th})^2(1+\lambda V_{DS})$$
> Where 𝜆 is the channel-length modulation parameter, which is a constant that is typically $0.01 V^{-1}$. It can be determined by extending $I_D\ vs\ V_{DS}$ lines and finding the intersect at $- V_{DS}$
![[56.png|400]]

**The MOSFET transconductance is**
$$g_m=\frac{\delta I_D}{\delta V_{GS}}=\frac{2I_D}{V_{GS}-V_{th}}=\frac{2I_D}{V_{ov}}$$
> where $V_{ov} = V_{GS}– V_{th}$ is called the overdrive voltage.

$$A_V=-g_mR_D$$
## Depletion MOSFET

> Unlike enhancement-mode transistors, which are “normally-off” devices, depletion mode MOSFETs are “normally-on”.

![[58.png|400]]
> (b) $V_{GS} = 0$, $I_D$ increases with $V_{DS}$ . Eventually at $V_{DS} = V_{DS(sat)}$, the channel is pinched off and $I_D$ becomes saturated at $I_{DSS}$.
> (c) **Depletion mode:** When $V_{GS}$ is negative, the channel has a lower conductance and pinch-off occurs at a lower $V_{DS}$
> (d) **Enhancement mode:** When $V_{GS}$ is positive, the channel has a higher conductance and pinch-off occurs at a higher $V_{DS}$

# MOSFET Switching
1. Majority of MOSFETs are used in digital applications.
2. Logical levels “0” and “1” correspond to the $on$ and $off$ states of the transistor.
3. The basic MOSFET switching circuit is the MOS invertor shown opposite.
![[60.png|400]]
> The current through the load resistor _R_ is given by $\frac{𝑉_{𝐷𝐷}−𝑉_o}{𝑅}$ the load line.
> The typical value for the load resistor is _R_=1 MΩ.
> A $dc$ current flows through the invertor when the driver is ON. This causes a significant power dissipation in an integrated circuit with millions invertors.

# CMOS (Complementary MOS)
## NFET & PFET
![[61.png]]
> **When $V_g = V_{dd}$ , the NFET is on and the PFET is off.
> When $V_g = 0$, the PFET is on and the NFET is off.**

## CMOS
The complementary nature of NFETs and PFETs makes it possible to design low-power circuits called **CMOS** or **complementary MOS** circuits.
A CMOS inverter is made of a PFET **_pull-up device_** and a NFET **_pull-down device_**.
![[62.png|400]]
> When input voltage $V_g= V_{dd}$, the NFET is on and the PFET is off (think of them as simple on–off switches), and the output node is pulled down to the ground ($V_{out}= 0$).
> When input voltage $V_g= 0$, the NFET is off and the PFET is on; the output node is pulled up to $V_{dd}$.
> In either case, one of the two transistors is off and there is no current flow from $V_{dd}$ through the two transistors directly to the ground. Therefore, CMOS circuits consume much less power than other types of circuits.
